# Onboarding

Steps:
-   [ ] Fork this repository into your account.
-   [ ] Dynamically remove all `Analog Input` columns with dead sensors. These are sensors whose values stay constant. (Have the code determine which sensors are dead as this can change).
-   [ ] Graph the RPM and TPS columns separately (or in the same graph for fun lol).
-   [ ] Submit a PR back to this repository with your code.
-   [ ] Send me (@sq.id on Discord) a message with a link to your PR and which projects you are most interested in contributing to.

We have an open door policy but require new members to follow basic coding structures to get into team projects.
